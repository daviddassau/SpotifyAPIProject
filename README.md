# SpotifyAPIPractice

### Features
- View all content/rows that meet criteria for SpotifyNewDeal2 feed or Naxos of America, INC Licensor. It would make the most sense for this to be organized VIA a datatable.
  - In the datatable, the two most necessary columns are the Track URI and Album URI.
  - Other columns would/could be Artist Name, Track Name, Label, etc.
- Each row of content in the datatable would have a "View Details" button, which would direct them to a page with all details/columns for that particular row.
- The datatable would have certain filtering capabilities, allowing the user to search/filter down the results when they're looking for something specific.
- Ability to either batch-add tracks to a playlist the user has created, or have the app automatically add tracks to a playlist, based off of certain criteria.
